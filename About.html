                These four words are not merely a statement. Rather they form a profound truth. It is one that has been guiding us in our quest as we help businesses envision the possibilities of tomorrow’s immersive tech today. Our journey began in 2014. XR was the next big thing. Industry 4.0 was the new standard. And the Internet of Things was a glimmer on the horizon. However, we believed in now rather than next. Bearing that in mind, we set out to connect people and ideas by helping them to harness the potential of XR via a seamless integration of technology and art. Along the way, we changed how businesses thought and worked. Some would say reality has its limits. But we beg to differ. Today, we continue to push the possibilities of XR, leveraging our strengths of Content Creation and Enterprise Application. Be it a start-up or a Fortune 500 company, we are focused on empowering every business to bring its ideas to life.

            <br>
            <p>
                When TILTLABS was founded in 2014, little did we know how far we would come. With the support and mentorship of late industry veteran Mr. Sasikumar Sehker, we set out to re-imagine and redefine the possibilities of AR, VR and MR.

            <br>
            <p>
                My passion for transformation can perhaps be traced to my childhood. I was always curious and interested in how things function. This, in turn, put me on a journey of more than 12 years, picking up knowledge on software development. Along the way, it sparked an interest in the world of immersive technologies for web, mobile and cloud domains. It wasn’t long before Virtual and Augmented Reality, Block Chain, AI and IOT technologies became my calling.
