                    Bioinformatics is a field of science that combines biology, data and information engineering to analyze and interpret biological information. It holds particular importance in the medical industry for processes such as DNA sequencing. Our AR and VR solutions play a critical role in this segment in terms of enabling more accurate analysis of the data through proper visualization. To this end, we have partnered with leading global universities.

              <p>Virtual Reality or VR is a computer-generated, interactive visual that replaces the real world and surrounds the user. It is an immersive experience, which means that the user’s presence is simulated into a real or virtual world, and s/he can experience or interact with the objects in that world. For instance, a user simulated into a computer-generated bedroom, where s/he can move pieces of furniture to redecorate. Head-mounted displays, such as Google Cardboard or cameras like GoPro Odyssey are some of the popular hardware that offer VR experiences.</p>
              <p>Augmented Reality or AR is also an interactive, computer-created, immersive experience, where digital assets are overlaid on real-world visuals. With AR, users can interact with both real-world and digitally enhanced assets; however, the contents are not necessarily connected to each other. For example, a user’s real bedroom, which s/he can enhance by placing computer-generated pieces of furniture or décor to visualize how these items would appear in real life. The Pokémon Go game is one of the most popular examples of augmented reality.</p>
              <p>Mixed Reality or MR, which is also known as hybrid reality, is an immersive experience, where real-world assets and computer-generated enhancements are integrated and can interact with each other. One must note that AR and MR tend to overlap and used interchangeably, which is not completely wrong; just that MR is an advanced kind of AR. Microsoft HoloLens is a well-known MR headset.</p>

VR, AR and MR are all interactive and immersive technologies that work with computer-generated assets. VR is generally used as a blanket term to define all the three technologies. However, they defer in how various real-world and CG contents interact with each other and the user. Virtual Reality is restricted to computer-generated assets, where, in a synthetic world, synthetic contents are placed and a simulated user interacts with the various elements. Augmented and mixed reality overlap since both have an overlay of CG assets on the real world. However, in AR the CG contents are not anchored to the real-world assets, while in MR they are, and therefore are capable of interacting with each other.

                The world of VR, AR and MR, collectively known as immersive tech, is for so much more than just gaming. It is now being used by companies and brands to engage more deeply with their customers in many different ways. Immersive tech has made a massive impact on how advertising and marketing functions. It elevates the ad experience by being more interactive, ensuring longer engagement with the ad. Immersive technologies have also boosted customers’ pre and post shopping experiences—for instance, the ability to test a product before purchase, such as apparels, cars or furniture, or understand the workings of a newly bought device without reading through its manuals. Industries like healthcare, education, manufacturing and so on are increasingly turning to immersive tech to train new workforces, transfer knowledge from retiring staff, virtually transport learners to the ‘field’ for real-time training, etc. The possibilities are endless, even spurring traditional industries to explore technologies and push the limits.

                <p>The XR industry (VR+AR+MR) is projected to grow to nearly 400 billion USD by 2025.  Its potential is evident in a range of industries, such as retail, healthcare, manufacturing and repair/maintenance and education, among others. Businesses and innovators focusing on workforce empowerment and customer interaction and experience enhancement will want to leverage the strengths of immersive technologies. Investments in immersive technologies can be high, based on a business’s need and target audience, and also the kind of technology that is used. Costs may start at $5-10k and may go up to $50-100k based on applications, hardware and platforms, research and development, and so on. Having clarity on your target market and the type of platform most suitable for your project will help in deciding the costings.</p>
